# GEAS: Game Engine? Absurd! Silly!

Geas is a 2D platforming game engine (WIP) written in C++, utilising OpenGL.

# Goals!

  - A whopping two whole dimensions of 8bit colour!
  - Simple physics and collisions!
  - Sounds! There will be some!
  - Able to run on a potato laptop - a game shouldn't necessitate
    top-of-the-line hardware, especially for a simple 2D platformer.
  - cross compatibility between the operating systems (MacOS, Windows, and
    Linux).
